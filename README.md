# DataBaseHelpers
A Practice Repo meant for helping engineers work through different CRUD within both relational and non-relational databases.

TODO -
implement mongo/mongoose database directory with skeleton data to help get things going for student (making assignment really only about the query calls)
  --the intention here is for the student to complete the MySQL portion of the sprint, then move on to Mongo by through some refactoring on the students end.

CSS on the front end to make look presentable and on par with / better than other SEIR practice repos

Write out README with pictures and instructions on how to set up, test, and complete this repo

Offer links to the getting started pages and other helpful posts about how to set up these database connections and making query calls
